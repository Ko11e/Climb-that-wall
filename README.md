## Planing

## Structure

### Database

### Wifeframe

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create wireframes for 'Climb That Wall' in order to plan the content flow and styling. Although there are some differences between the original wireframes and the final product, these variances are the result of design decisions made during the creative process.

## Design Choices

### Color Scheme

The color palette have been collected from the origal background image. However, the background on the website has a filter with a soft Off-White pick from the image in this [link](docs/images/Background-before-after.png) can the before and after be seen. For the background image is this color palette carefully chosen to create a harmonious balance between tranquility and energy. The combination of soft neutrals and muted tones, punctuated by vibrant and warm hues, ensures a versatile and visually engaging design. Each color has been selected to complement and enhance the others, resulting in a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing ensemble.
